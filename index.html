          <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>Bike Haven was founded in 2010 by two lifelong cycling enthusiasts, Jane and Mike. After years of working in the cycling industry, they decided to strike out on their own and open a bike shop that was different from the rest.</p>
    <p>From the beginning, Jane and Mike were committed to creating a space that was welcoming, inclusive, and focused on providing the best possible customer service. They wanted to offer more than just bikes and gear - they wanted to build a community of passionate cyclists who could share their love of cycling with others.</p>
    <p>Over the years, Bike Haven has grown and evolved, but our commitment to excellence has remained the same. We're still dedicated to providing top-quality bikes and accessories, as well as expert advice and support for cyclists of all levels. We're still passionate about helping our customers find the perfect bike and gear to suit their needs, and we're still committed to building a community of enthusiastic and supportive riders.</p>
    <p>So whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, we invite you to come be a part of the Bike Haven community. We'd love to share our love of cycling with you!</p>
